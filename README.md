# Rust Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game written in the Rust programming language. The goal is to guess a randomly generated number, with the help of hints, until you find the correct one. This program was adapted from the "Programming a Guessing Game" tutorial in the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

I expanded on the original guessing game by adding a custom hint system and dynamic range settings for guesses.

## Purpose

I'm in the process of learning Rust (I'm one day in, lol). This project was created as a learning exercise while studying the Rust programming language. It extends the original tutorial by adding more complexity and user interaction. 

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or copy the source code.
2. Run the game using `cargo run`.
3. Follow the instructions to set the guessing range, make your guesses, and enjoy the hints along the way.
